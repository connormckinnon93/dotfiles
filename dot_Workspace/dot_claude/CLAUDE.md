# Knowledge Workspace

**YOU ARE** operating in a dedicated knowledge work environment at `~/Workspace/`.

## Workspace Identity

This workspace is designed for document-focused work using Anthropic's knowledge work and document skills. When working here, prioritize:

- Document creation and manipulation
- Structured output generation
- Research and knowledge synthesis
- Task organization and productivity

## Available Document Skills

The following document skills are globally enabled and available for use:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `docx` | Create, edit, and analyze Word documents |
| `pdf` | Create and manipulate PDF files |
| `pptx` | Create and edit PowerPoint presentations |
| `xlsx` | Create and manipulate Excel spreadsheets |

**Invoke skills** using their full namespace: `anthropic-agent-skills:docx`, etc.

## Available Knowledge Work Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `productivity` | Task management, calendars, daily workflows |

**Invoke skills** using their full namespace: `anthropic-knowledge-work:productivity`.

## File Handling

- **ALWAYS** save generated documents to `~/Workspace/` or its subdirectories
- **ORGANIZE** outputs into logical subdirectories (e.g., `~/Workspace/documents/`, `~/Workspace/presentations/`)
- **CREATE** subdirectories as needed without asking
- **NAME** files descriptively using kebab-case (e.g., `quarterly-report-q1-2026.docx`)

## Parallel Work

- **WHEN** working on multiple independent documents, use subagents to work in parallel
- **COORDINATE** parallel workstreams through clear task decomposition
- **MERGE** outputs only after all parallel work completes

## Safety Boundaries

- **CONFIRM** before any destructive operations (overwriting existing files, bulk deletions)
- **SCOPE** all file operations to `~/Workspace/` unless explicitly directed otherwise
- **NEVER** modify files outside `~/Workspace/` without explicit user permission
- **PRESERVE** originals when editing existing documents (create copies first)
